<p>Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Movie Reviewer (“Movie Reviewer” or “We” or “Us”), which operates the web site located at http://Movie Reviewer.com and related application programming interfaces (API’s), mobile applications and online services (the “Website”). The following Terms of Service are a legal contract between you (“You”) and Movie Reviewer regarding your use of the Website. Visitors and users of the Website are referred to individually as “User” and collectively as “Users”.</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. BY REGISTERING FOR, ACCESSING, BROWSING, OR USING THE WEBSITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE Movie Reviewer PRIVACY NOTICE AND ANY ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES (AS DEFINED BELOW) (COLLECTIVELY, THE “TERMS”). </p>
<p>IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND YOU PROVIDE CONSENT FOR YOUR CHILD TO REGISTER WITH THE WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IN RESPECT OF SUCH CHILD’S USE OF THE WEBSITE.</p>
<p>1. Eligibility; Accounts. THE WEBSITE IS NOT AVAILABLE TO (A) ANY USERS PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED OR REMOVED FROM THE WEBSITE BY Movie Reviewer OR (B) ANY PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 13 WHOSE REGISTRATION HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY A LEGAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN. By clicking the “I Agree” button or by otherwise using or registering an account for the Website, You represent (a) that You have not been previously suspended or removed from the Website by Movie Reviewer; (b) that You are either (i) at least 13 years of age or (ii) Your parent and/or guardian has consented to Your use of the Website; and (c) that your registration and your use of the Website is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. </p>
<p style="padding-left:50px">1.1 Account. In order to use certain features of the Website, you must register for an account. You may be asked to provide a password in connection with your account. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You agree that the information You provide to Movie Reviewer, whether at registration or at any other time, will be true, accurate, current, and complete. You also agree that You will ensure that this information is kept accurate and up-to-date at all times. If You have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure (e.g., in the event of a loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure or use of your account ID or password), then You agree to immediately notify Movie Reviewer. You may be liable for the losses incurred by Movie Reviewer or others due to any unauthorized use of your Website account.</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px">1.2 Integrated Service. Movie Reviewer may permit You to register for the Website through, or otherwise associate your Movie Reviewer account with, certain third party social networking or integrated services, such as Facebook Connect and Google (“Integrated Service”). By registering for the Website using (or otherwise granting access to) an Integrated Service, you agree that Movie Reviewer may access your Integrated Service’s account information, and you agree to any and all terms and conditions of the Integrated Service regarding your use of the Website via the Integrated Service. You agree that any Integrated Service is a Reference Site (as defined below) and you are solely responsible for your interactions with the Integrated Service as a result of accessing the Website through the Integrated Service. Movie Reviewer does not control the practices of Integrated Services, and you are advised to read the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of any Integrated Service that you use to understand their practices.</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px">1.3 Child User. If You are a User of the Website and are under the age of 13 (“Child User”), You may not register an account for the Website without consent and approval from your legal parent or guardian. A Child User that begins the registration process for himself or herself without a Parent User may have the registration process restricted until a Parent User approves or assumes responsibility for the Child User account. Additionally, a Child User may use the Website if registered through certain educational organizations or, in certain cases (as defined below), by Coaches that have entered into a relationship directly with Movie Reviewer and through which education organization or Coach the legal parent and/or guardian of such Child User has consented to use of the Website. Further, in certain instances, a Child User may use our Website via one of the third party applications that integrate into or with the Website. A Child User that has registered through such external educational organizations, third party applications, or Coaches will only be permitted to use the Website for so long as Movie Reviewer reasonably believes that such access has been consented to by the Child User’s parent or guardian. </p>

If You are at least 18 years of age and you are the legal parent or guardian of a child that seeks to register as a Child User of the Website, You may register a parent account on the Website (“Parent User”). As a Parent User, you may create, register, manage and approve Child User accounts only for your own child(ren) or child(ren) for whom you are a legal guardian. IF YOU REGISTER, APPROVE THE REGISTRATION OF, OR OTHERWISE ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CHILD USER, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE SUCH CHILD USER’S LEGAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS ON BEHALF OF SUCH CHILD USER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BEING LIABLE FOR ALL USE OF THE WEBSITE BY THE CHILD USER. You acknowledge that Movie Reviewer may choose, but is not obligated, to make any inquiries, either directly or through third parties, that Movie Reviewer deems necessary to validate Your registration information, including without limitation engaging third parties to provide verification services. Movie Reviewer reserves all rights to take legal actions against anyone who misrepresents personal information or is otherwise untruthful about their identity. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT Movie Reviewer CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY ANY USER AND Movie Reviewer IS NOT OBLIGATED TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF ANY USER, INCLUDING ANY USER’S CLAIM TO BE A PARENT USER, OR TO VERIFY THAT A PARENT IDENTIFIED BY A CHILD USER OR A COACH DURING REGISTRATION IS SUCH CHILD USER’S ACTUAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN. A Parent User account, along with all associated Child User accounts, may be terminated by Movie Reviewer at any time and without warning for any failure to abide by these Terms. </p>
